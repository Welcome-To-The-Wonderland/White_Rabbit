# Manga-Reader
My Attempt at creating a manga reader
1. Kiss manga scraper
   - Scrape images chapter-wise
   - Store images (where? Client side?)
3. use scraper to display images
   - update application every day at 4 am (automate this process)
4. Possible features???
   - Keep track of read/unread/current chapter
   - sort by latest read, latest download, latest release (needs more scraping info),
   - Double page view feature, read from left to right, long strip view, single page view
   - automated alerts of new chapters, new content by an author, etc
   - recommendations list based on
      - users of similar interest
         - genre, author, description summary key terms, stars
         - (could use MAL api????)
         - So excited :D XD >v<
5. Integrate SQL
   - utilize a relational data base to...
   - store info on a user
      - what info bruh, figure our specifics
   - store info about a particular manga, author, tags, genre, etc
      - could we utilize this to store the images of the manga themselves?
        (maybe we can use this to store then grab the Manag_tite -> chapter -> page1, then page2, etc)

App Plan: 
- PRIORITY TO GET IOS APP RUNNING
- Maybe use React to develop since it works well with web, android, ios



NOTE: 
Look into My Anime List API (MAL api)
  - Gives Summary
  - Release date
  - ratings
