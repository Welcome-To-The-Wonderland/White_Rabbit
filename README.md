# Manga-Reader
My Attempt at creating a manga reader
1. Kiss manga scraper
   - Scrape images chapter-wise
   - Store images (where? Client side?)
3. use scraper to display images
4. Possible features???
   - Keep track of read/unread/current chapter
   - sort by latest read, latest download, latest release (needs more scraping info),
   - Double page view feature, read from left to right, long strip view, single page view
  

App Plan: 
- PRIORITY TO GET IOS APP RUNNING
- Maybe use React to develop since it works well with web, android, ios



NOTE: 
Look into My Anime List API (MAL api)
  - Gives Summary
  - Release date
  - ratings
